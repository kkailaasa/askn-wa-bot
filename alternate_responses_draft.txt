I need you to do only this help for me - 

I have these msgs responses incase of errors and failures and I like it:

class MessageResponse:

    """Helper class for constructing appropriate message responses"""

    @staticmethod

    def system_error() -> str:

        return ("Were facing technical difficulties right now. "

                "Please try your request again in a few moments.")

    @staticmethod

    def rate_limit(reset_time: int) -> str:

        return ("I notice you're sending messages quite quickly. "

                f"Please wait {reset_time} seconds before sending another message.")

    @staticmethod

    def sequence_error(error_type: str) -> str:

        responses = {

            "INVALID_PHONE": "The phone number you provided doesn't seem to be valid. "

                           "Please provide a valid phone number.",

            "INVALID_EMAIL": "The email address doesn't seem to be valid. "

                           "Please provide a valid email address.",

            "SEQUENCE_VIOLATION": "Let's start over with your request. "

                                "What would you like to do?",

            "KEYCLOAK_ERROR": "I'm unable to verify your information right now. "

                            "Would you like to try again or help you with something else?",

            "DATA_NOT_FOUND": "I seem to have lost track of our previous conversation. "

                            "Could you please start over?",

            "DEFAULT": "I ran into an issue processing your request. "

                      "Would you like to try again or help you with something else?"

I want these to be the responses for those respective errors
